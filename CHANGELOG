=== Version 0.6.0, Jun 23, 2010 ===

This release brings a new view, together with many other changes. Unfortunately the DB Schema had to be changed, so it is not compatible with existing databases without migration. The decision was taken in order to make the executable model simpler.

    * DB Modifications:
        o Executable: removed coptions and added a description field, as it really didn't bring much and it made things unecessarily complicated. This is the main reason for a DB change
        o Benchmark: Added a units_title field, which is used as plot title
        o Charfield lengths where adjusted
    * New feature: Comparison view
        o Normal bar charts
        o Cumulative bar charts
        o Relative bar charts
        o Horizontal or verical orientation
    * Name change: Overview became Changes
        o Removal of inline plot bars (covered now by the comparison view)
        o Added environment and executable info box
    * Timeline view:
        o Allow to select a baseline
        o Added plot title


=== Version 0.5, May 10, 2010 ===

The focus of this release was polishing, making everything work seamlessly and cementing the DB design. The DB Schema should remain stable from now on. Last but not least, the installation and configuration process of codespeed was greatly simplified and is now documented.

I believe codespeed is now ready for general use.
Thanks go to Joe and to Oriol Rius for their feedback, which made this posible.
Changelog

    * DB Modifications:
          o Project Model got repo fields renamed and 2 new repo fields added
          o Changed Project field “isdefault” to “track”
          o Some fields got their char length adjusted
    * Documentation: Added README with installation and configuration instructions
    * SVN integration: get logs from repos that need user/password
    * Defaults: default settings.py DB is now sqlite3

          o Allow selection of any revision via URL
    * Timeline:
          o Completed timeline – overview integration: clicking on a data point redirects to overview for that revision and executable
          o Allow viewing arbitrary number of revisions (via URL)
    * Style: smaller logo, and some other style touches
    * Templates: only define speedcenter name in base.html

=== Version 0.4, April 13, 2010 ===

    * DB Redesign (http://github.com/tobami/codespeed/blob/master/documentation/backend.png)
          o New Project model
          o Benchmark model now has units and associated lessisbetter field
          o Revision model: make usable with git and other DCVS by having a commitid charfield instead of version number. Add branch field.
          o Interpreter model changed to Executable. It is now associated to a Project.
          o Result model now has std deviation, max, and min optional fields. Result_type removed (in Benchmark model now).
    * Revision control integration
          o Integration for svn implemented, others like git are possible
    * Added Home and About pages
    * Overview
          o Revisions labels now include date (you can’t memorize commitid in git)
          o Allow selecting of executable and revision to compare to.
          o Add std dev column
          o Show all commit logs between the selected revision and the (tested) one preceding it.
